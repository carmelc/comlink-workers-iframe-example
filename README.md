# Vite + Comlink

This is a simple example of how to use Comlink with React.
It is showing how to create bi-directional communication between a worker/iframe and the main thread.

[Comlink docs](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/comlink/blob/main/README.md) are not very clear on how to use it to communicate from the Endpoint to the main thread, so I created this example to help others.
